package com.albertcbraun.cms50fwlib;

/**
 * Holds a collection of distinct properties  measured and written out by the CMS50FW
 * for each cycle of the 60HZ data stream:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Pulse Wave Form:</b> (0-127) y values on the line graph</li>
 * <li><b>Pulse Intensity:</b> (0-15) height of bar on the bar graph</li>
 * <li><b>Pulse Rate:</b> (0-127) number of heartbeats per minute. <b>Please note: this library does not currently accurately report pulse rates above 127 BPM.</b></li>
 * <li><b>SpO2:</b> (0-100%) blood oxygen saturation level</li>
 * <li><b>Finger Sleeve Status:</b> (boolean) whether the finger being measured is positioned properly</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In addition, there is a <i>time</i> property which is <i>not</i> generated by the
 * CMS50FW.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this library generates the timestamp when the data is read out of
 * the CMS50FW's bluetooth input stream. So, this timestamp marks a time
 * <i>slightly later</i> than the time when the accompanying data was actually measured
 * by the CMS50FW.
 * <p>
 * Please note that these properties are only a subset of all the available
 * data written by the CMS50FW.
