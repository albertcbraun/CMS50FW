## Credits 

This library was informed, inspired and guided significantly by Yujia Yan's GitHub project: 

https://github.com/Yujia-Yan/CMS50SerialProtocolKit 

which works on a slightly earlier version of the Contec CMS50. Many kind thanks to Yujia Yan for that code. Any misunderstandings or misinterpretations belong to me. 

## Contents of this Android Studio project

There are two Android Studio modules in this project. One is the android library project "cms50fwlib". The other is a test app named "cms50fwlibtestapp". 

The cms50fwlib project outputs an aar file. This library tries to simplify the Android code required to detect the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CMS50FW+Pulse+Oximeter#q=CMS50FW+Pulse+Oximeter&safe=off&tbm=shop">CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter</a>, obtain a bluetooth connection to it, read the data stream, and turn it into a convenient object.

The cms50fw test app tries to read the Bluetooth data stream in real-time, writes pulse and oxygen level data to the screen, and also tries to alert the end user if it thinks it has detected a problem (e.g. oxygen level too low). 

### CMS50FWLib 

The basic steps for using the cms50fwlib are:

Implement a custom [CMS50FWConnectionListener](https://github.com/albertcbraun/CMS50FW/blob/master/cms50fwlib/src/main/java/com/albertcbraun/cms50fwlib/CMS50FWConnectionListener.java) instance for your app Activity or Fragment. (An example of this is found in the test app project.) 

Now, obtain an instance of the [CMS50FWBluetoothConnectionManager](https://github.com/albertcbraun/CMS50FW/blob/master/cms50fwlib/src/main/java/com/albertcbraun/cms50fwlib/CMS50FWBluetoothConnectionManager.java): 
````
cms50FWBluetoothConnectionManager = new CMS50FWBluetoothConnectionManager("SpO202"); 
````

Call setCMS50FWConnectionListener on the CMS50FWBluetoothConnectionManager instance, feeding in your custom implementation of CMS50FWConnectionListener: 
````
cms50FWBluetoothConnectionManager.setCMS50FWConnectionListener(cms50fwCallbacks);
````

At this point, you should have your Contec CMS50FW turned on and the 'wireless' setting should also be set to 'on'. 

Once that is done, call connect on the cms50FWBluetoothConnectionManager, feeding it an instance of [an Android Context object](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html): 
````
cms50FWBluetoothConnectionManager.connect(aContextObject) 
````

At this point, there will be a delay while the Bluetooth "machinery" on your Android device carries out discovery and tries to find the CMS50FW. It should take about 10 seconds (or less). 

If the connection succeeds, you will be called back on your implementation of the method CMS50FWConnectionListener.onConnectionEstablished. 

Once that has happened, you can ask the CMS50FW to start streaming data: 
````
cms50FWBluetoothConnectionManager.startData()
````
You should start to see callbacks about 60 times per second on your implementation of the method CMS50FWConnectionListener.onDataFrameArrived. The cms50fwlib library feeds onDataFrameArrived a convenient  [DataFrame](https://github.com/albertcbraun/CMS50FW/blob/master/cms50fwlib/src/main/java/com/albertcbraun/cms50fwlib/DataFrame.java) object whose properties can be read in your client. 


### CMS50FWLibTestApp 

The test app can be compiled as part of this Android Studio project or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.albertcbraun.cms50fw.alert">installed directly from the Google Play Store.</a>

## jCenter Reference
You can get the cms50fwlib directly from the jCenter repository. Add this to your Android Studio project's build.gradle: 
````
compile(group: 'com.albertcbraun.cms50fwlib', name: 'cms50fwlib', version: '0.5.1')
````
